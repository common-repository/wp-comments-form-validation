# Wordpress Comments Form Validation

Wordpress Comments Form Validation is an open source plugin to add the [jQuery Validation plugin](http://jqueryvalidation.org/) functionality to the Wordpress comments form.

## Installation

1. Click on the 'Download Zip' button located in the sidebar of this page.
2. Login to your WordPress admin area and go to Plugins Â» Add New.
3. Select 'Upload' and navigate to the file you downloaded (most likely in your 'Downloads' folder).

## Issues

This plugin was designed to work with the default comment form markup, it _should_ work with most themes if they have stuck to the same naming conventions for field names.

## Tips

#### Remove Default Styling

If you would like to use your own styling for the error elements then you can easily remove the default styling by placing the following code inside a 'wp_enqueue_scripts' callback function.

```php
function themeslug_dequeue_style() {
	wp_dequeue_style( 'wp-cf-validation' );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'themeslug_dequeue_style' );
```
